# Jolt -- Mobile Dating App with Flutter
This is a cross-platform mobile application that I made using Flutter and Google Cloud Platform for authentication and storage. This app allows you to see fellow users that are located at the same restaurant/bar, and send them a friendly 'wave' or 'wink' to break the ice. If accepted, users can use the built in chat featured to chat more, but they are encouraged to get out there and interact like normal humans. Most of the proof of concept here is working such as authentication, location services, nearby users, chat functionality, wave/wink functionality, ability to turn off location services etc. However, the next step is to go through and make it beautiful. Currently, I beliveve that the chat interface looks pretty bare bones, as well as some other potential views.
