1. Can add user to authentication but have scenarios where they aren't added to users table
2. Need to make sure camera works on ios
3. Logout button not working?

subscribe("Topic", Callback)
{
    switch(Topic)
    {
        case NearbyUsers:
            usersSub = listenForNearbyUsers(callback)
        default:
            break;
    }
}

unsubscribe("Topic")
{
    switch(Topic){
        case (nearbyUsers):
            usersSub();
    }
}
